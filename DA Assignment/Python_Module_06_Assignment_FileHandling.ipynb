    "### 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, while compiled languages translate code to machine language before execution, offering faster performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "It is a process for responding to runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks, preventing program crashes and enabling controlled responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "The finally block ensures certain code runs regardless of whether an exception occurs, commonly used for resource cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Logging records program events, errors, or debugging information to files or consoles for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
    "The __del__ method acts as a destructor, called when an object is about to be destroyed, to handle cleanup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "import module brings in the full module, accessed as module.name, while from module import name imports only specific attributes directly for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "List multiple exceptions in a tuple within an except clause, or use several except blocks for different exception types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "Multithreading shares a single process memory among threads, suitable for I/O tasks, while multiprocessing runs tasks in separate processes for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "Logging helps in tracking errors, analyzing program flow, and auditing run-time events, aiding debugging and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "It refers to the way Python handles allocation and de-allocation of memory, primarily via automatic garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Use try to wrap risky code, handle exceptions in except, run optional code in else, and finalize with finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "It ensures efficient resource usage and prevents memory leaks and crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "try includes code that may raise errors, while except defines what to do when specific errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "Pythonâ€™s garbage collector reclaims unused memory automatically, mainly using reference counting and cyclic garbage detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "The else block runs code only if no exception occurs in the try section, helping separate error and normal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "The standard logging levels are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "os.fork() is Unix-specific for process creation; the multiprocessing module works cross-platform and provides higher-level process management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "Closing releases system resources, prevents data loss, and avoids file corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "file.read() reads the whole file or a specific size, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "The logging module manages recording events, errors, and other information for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "The os module provides tools for interacting with the operating system, like manipulating files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "Main challenges are detecting and handling reference cycles, and ensuring timely cleanup of unused resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "Use the raise keyword followed by an exception type, e.g., raise ValueError(\"Error message\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound applications to run multiple tasks concurrently and improve responsiveness"
